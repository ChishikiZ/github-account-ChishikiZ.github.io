<p>Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Jorge Zamago, and I am 27 years old. I am married, and will be having my first child with my wife, in June 8th! 
My wife's name is Laura, and I have been married with her for 2 years. I have been with her for 6 years and am excited to start my family with her. 
I was in the Marine Corps and spend 4 great years serving alongside many great men. After the military,
I decided I was going to become a truck driver and build a business by buying my own truck. As I drove around the US, I started to understand that this
lifestyle was similar to my military lifestyle in the sense of sacrificing time with my family. I was unable to be home for a lot of important times. I decided to look
for a local job in Phoenix in my same company. After 2 years working in my local job, I took a manager position. Now, my new goal is getting a Bachelor's in Software Development
and start a career in IT.</p>
<p>Please, look around my webpage and learn about me through pictures, brief descrptions, and videos.</p>
<!--In this paragraph I will introduce myself, talk a little bit about my life, and my wife.-->
